Django learning from FCC's "Python Django Web Framework - Full Course for Beginners" - https://youtu.be/F5mRW0jo-U4?si=aQjqNawEPofT8QpZ

Here, I use Django for multi-page full-stack web apps (worked with models, templates, dynamic URLs, requests, forms, views, handling class-based views such as ListView, DetailView, CreateView, UpdateView, and DeleteView, mixins, validation, GET/POST, error handling, managing objects in databases, namespacing, customization)
